I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

I've never seen it a full house, so its not good for people-watching. Its alright for an overpriced cocktail, but its too far away from home to be my corner bar. I paid $14 for two Tanqueray and tonics. Its a nice low key place to have a drink if you're in the neighborhood. \\n\\nI think they had happy hour from 10p to 1a. We ordered our first round at 950p and later ordered two more rounds and an appetizer. We didn't get any discount. \\n\\nThey have a small menu with dumplings ($7-8) and fried rice and a lot of Portugese-influenced dishes, like Carne de Porco with Green Beans ($13), as Macau was colonized by the Portugese. \\n\\nI think the bartender was saying something about the joint being built right around the time the whole no smoking in establishments that serve food law was being passed, so they came up with an agreement to outsource food from the \\\"Korean restaurant next door\\\" (I believe he was referring to Dae Jang Keum or DJK). Its convenient for them because they don't have to worry about kitchen health codes and pay for all of the equipment and worry about taking up precious bar stool space with a kitchen. But it took longer then it should've for my friend to get her steamed pork dumplings. And the bartender didn't seem that knowledgeable about the foods. \\\"Everything that I've tried is good.\\\" But its friggin' bar food, who cares how good it is? \\n\\nThe decor was nice. My friend loved the gold wall with velvet elaborations. The lounge in the back is really laid back. But there was no bar wench, so you have to order your drinks at the bar every round. \\n\\n* off the strip, non-casino</td>\n",

The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"
